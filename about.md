Overwhelmed by boilerplate bloat and difficulty *owning* the code for a website, this project is dedicated to getting back to the basics for hosting a site on GitHub Pages.

I previously worked with existing Jekyll templates, such as [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), as well as working with Flask frameworks hosted on Heroku. Without having dedicated frontend coding experience, working with these codebases required a steep learning curve with limited generalizability. I always dreamed of putting together a barebones static site from ~scratch~ to continue developing frontend skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jinja, fundamental JS frameworks, etc. The goal of this repo is:

> Create a sandbox to play, test, and learn frontend programming concepts.

To fully understand the intricacies and nuances of the code I'm deploying, I need to clear out the fancy CSS design, involved [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) structures, and mysterious [CDN calls](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/) found in other templates.

## Site Contents

At it's core, this site will still be a static website styled through [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/) and [hosted through GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).
